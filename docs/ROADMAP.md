# HabitFlow - MVP Scope & Roadmap

## App Summary
HabitFlow is a habit tracking app that replaces guilt-based streaks with compassionate,
context-aware tracking. It uses Flex Streaks™ (percentage-based consistency), smart context
tags, and actionable insights to help users build lasting habits without anxiety.

## Target Users
1. **Perfectionist Abandoners** (28-45, professionals) - Need forgiveness and progress reframing
2. **Inconsistent Enthusiasts** (22-35, creative) - Need flexibility and gentle accountability
3. **Methodical Builders** (25-50, analytical) - Need deep analytics and patterns
4. **Community Seekers** (20-40, social) - Need accountability and shared motivation

## Key Use Cases
- Create habits with implementation intentions ("After coffee, do 10 pushups")
- Track daily habits with single-tap completion
- View consistency trends without streak anxiety
- Understand patterns through weekly insights
- Pause habits during travel/illness without penalty
- Get gentle reminders and celebrations
